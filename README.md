A container <div> to hold the TO-DO list.
A header with an image.
An input box for entering new tasks.
A button to add tasks.

Styles for the body and container to center the TO-DO list and apply a background gradient.
Styles for the TO-DO list container, including padding, margin, and border-radius.
Styles for the input box, button, and task list items.
Special styles for checked tasks and hover effects for the remove button.
